# Discord Moderation Bot

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a moderation Discord bot that can automatically detect and remove inappropriate content such as hate speech, spam, and NSFW materials. The bot will be integrated with machine learning algorithms using TensorFlow to continuously improve its accuracy in detecting and moderating content. It will also include a reporting system where users can flag inappropriate content for manual review by moderators. A user-friendly dashboard will be created for moderators to easily manage reported content and take appropriate actions. Additional features such as warning and muting users who repeatedly violate community guidelines will be implemented. The bot will be regularly updated with new moderation techniques and algorithms, and feedback from users and moderators will be gathered to make necessary improvements to the bot's functionality and performance. Collaboration with Discord server owners will be encouraged to promote the bot and ensure its adoption within their communities. 24/7 technical support will be provided to address any issues or concerns raised by users or moderators. The bot's performance and effectiveness will be monitored through analytics and metrics to ensure it is meeting the desired moderation goals.

This README file provides an overview of the Discord moderation bot project and its components. Each file in the project directory serves a specific purpose and is interconnected to achieve the desired functionality. The main entry point is the `main.py` file, which orchestrates the bot's operations by interacting with other modules such as `moderation.py`, `machine_learning.py`, `reporting_system.py`, and `dashboard.py`. The data required for moderation and machine learning tasks is stored in files such as `moderation_data.csv`, `machine_learning_model.h5`, and `reported_content.json`.

For specific details on each file and its contents, refer to the respective files in the project directory.
